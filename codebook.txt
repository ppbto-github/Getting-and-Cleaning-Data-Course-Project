The script run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.
1. All the similar data is merged using the rbind() and cbind() function.
2. Then, only those columns with the mean and standard deviation measures are taken from the whole dataset. After extracting these columns, they are given the correct names, taken from features.txt.
3. As activity data is addressed with values 1:6, we take the activity names and IDs from activity_labels.txt and they are substituted in the dataset.
4. I changed vague column names with descriptive names
5. I generated a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type.
6. I created the following column names:
   x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
   x, y and datos merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
   features contains the correct names for the x dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in momentos_uno_dos, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.
7. Finally, tidy_dat.txt that contains the relevant averages by each subject and activity
